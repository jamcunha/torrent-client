# Torrent Client

This project aims to create a simple torrent client that can download
(and possibly upload) files using the BitTorrent protocol.

After the download is complete, I may add the magnet link support.

## Build

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
$ make
```

## Usage

To run the client, use the following command:

```bash
$ ./build/tc -t <torrent_file>
```

For more information, run the following command:

```bash
$ ./build/tc -h
```
